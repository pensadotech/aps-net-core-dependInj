Additioanlly, this project present the use of Services exstensions as a way to register services.
This presents many approaches for this, including the use of 'scutor' to register services on
execution time. 

The project also registers as service a background process using IHostedService. This process will 
execute at start and initialze teh users for the in memory database. 

	Note: 
	The solution has a main projec named "TennisBookigs" and several API projects under teh external folder.
	In order to work it is required to configure to start teh API projects first, with no debuging, and start with 
	debugging the main project. All API project must start before teh main project begins.

	In here select to use 'Multiple startup projects' and arrange and set as described. 

The project uses ain-memory database using SqlLite and through a hosted service(background service) 
initalizes users in the database (TennisBookings.BackgroundService.InitialiseDatabaseService)

	AdminEmail = "admin@example.com";
	MemberEmail = "member@example.com";
